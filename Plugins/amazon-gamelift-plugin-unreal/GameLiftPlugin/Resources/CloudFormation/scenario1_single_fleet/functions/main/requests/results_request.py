def handler(event, context):
    """
    Handles requests to describe the game session connection information after a StartGame request.
     This function will look up the MatchmakingRequest table to find a pending matchmaking request by
     the player, and if it is QUEUED, look up the GameSessionPlacement table to find the game's
     connection information.
    :param event: lambda event, contains the region to player latency mapping in `regionToLatencyMapping` key, as well
     as the player information from the Cognito id tokens. Cognito provides a `sub` user attribute that we use as a 
     Player ID. Unlike `username` value `sub` is UUID for a user which is never reassigned to another user.
    :param context: lambda context, not used by this function
    :return:
     - 200 (OK) if the game connection is ready, along with server info: "IpAddress", "Port", "DnsName", "PlayerSessionId", "PlayerId"
     - 204 (No Content) if the requested game is still in progress of matchmaking
     - 404 (Not Found) if no game has been started by the player, or if all started game were expired
     - 500 (Internal Error) if errors occurred during matchmaking or placement
